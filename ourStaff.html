	<h1>Claude Bourgelat</h1>
</center>
	<p>Veterinary medicine as we know it would not exist were it not for Dr. Claude Bourgelat. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) reports he founded the first veterinary school in Lyons, France, near the end of 1761 after years of work to establish the necessary reputation and connections. Dr. Bourgelat initially planned to pursue a law career but could never shake his love for horses. He began to study with two surgeons to learn about animal pathology, physiology, and anatomy. Dr. Bourgelat eventually formulated plans to open a veterinary school when he realized there wasn’t any degree offered that could adequately prepare someone to practice veterinary medicine. Focusing on preventing livestock disease was one of Dr. Bourgelat’s primary motivations for establishing vet schools. A deadly disease called rinderpest was incredibly common at the time. Though Dr. Bourgelat didn’t live to see the end of this veterinary health concern, it was officially eradicated in 2011.</p>

	<h1>Bernhard Lauritz Frederik Bang</h1>
</center> 
	<p>To say Danish Veterinarian Dr. Bernhard Lauritz Frederik Bang was an overachiever would be an understatement. He had a knack for languages, studying Latin, Greek, English, French, and German. He also obtained degrees in both human and animal medicine. Dr. Bang grew increasingly interested in zoonotic diseases and became involved in scientific research. His efforts led him to discover the type of bacteria that causes brucellosis, which can lead to miscarriages for cows and flu-like illness for humans. He was also among the first to demonstrate the importance of heating milk to kill bacteria. For his contributions to human and animal health, Dr. Bang was awarded numerous honorary degrees. He also became an honorary member of the International Veterinary Congress in 1932.</p>

	<h1>Elinor McGrath</h1> 
</center>
	<p>Little is known about the first women veterinarians. Though Dr. Mignon Nicholson is the first known female veterinary school graduate, no records of her practicing exist. Then there’s Dr. Florence Kimball, who turned to nursing shortly after pursuing her veterinary degree. Though there are still some unanswered questions about Dr. Elinor McGrath, we do know she graduated from veterinary school in 1910. She began a small-animal practice in Chicago, IL, shortly after. While this is a pretty typical route today, it was much more common for veterinarians to focus on farm animals in the early 20th century. Dr. McGrath went on to marry a fellow veterinarian. She shared her veterinary medical knowledge at the 1933 World’s Fair and was appointed Assistant Illinois State Veterinarian in 1939.</p>
